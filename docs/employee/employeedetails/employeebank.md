# Employee Details Bank

**BANK**  
This is required if the employee is being paid by Giro or Transfer.

**Account Name**  
This is the employee's bank account details.

**Sort Code**  
Enter the 6 digit bank code.

**Account No**  
Enter the 8 digit number. If they are being paid to a Building Soc leave blank.

**Building S. A/c**  
This can be a mixture of numbers  & characters.

**Autopay**  
If you are paying via AutoPay enter the ref number here.
You need to mark the Pay Method as 'Giro' if you want a Fax printout.

<!-- **Send BACS hash code**  
Since 2004 this is no longer used  
The HMRC BACS Ref code, like this '/AB1', can be sent to the bank via RTI BACS approved layout files.
This is needed if you pay your employees via BACS DIRECT. A BACS DIRECT will have their own Service User Number, (SUN).
The bank then creates a hash of this made up of the BACS Ref code, plus Employers Sort Code, plus the Employee Sort Code and the Net amount of the pay.
The bank then sends this Hash to HMRC.
A Hash looks like this:
a8e88f215cc98f40a2d0c47c49d0b09f4593d9bb81aef118202987a8cc0e3689
CalcPay will produce the same Hash, and send it via the FPS. HMRC can tie up the Hashs and then know that the stated net amount was actually paid.
Tick this if you use bank software that transmits the HMRC BACS Ref code.
CalcPay always produces the HMRC BACS Ref code.
