If an employee **leaves** during Maternity you are still obliged to pay for the maternity pay.  
This can be done 2 ways:  
1) She leaves and gets a P45. You then process the SMP by clicking on 'Employee/EmployeeDetails' 'Make payment after leaving', this will change the Tax Code to 0T wk1/mt1 basis.  
The SMP will still be calculated for each pay period.  
2) You pay her the sum due for the rest of the SMP in one lump payment. This will require you to Create a new pay heading called say 'Maternity Pay Balance'.  
You enter the amount you are due to pay her. nb you will also be due to pay her any outstanding Holiday Pay.  
In the Payrun & 'ProcessPay', 'Parenting' TAB,  Mark any weeks being currently paid as 'Missed', this will mean that there is no entry in the 'Calc' TAB under 'Parenting'.  
After you have printed payslips and reports update records as normal.  
In 'Utilities/MidYearStart' enter the same date as you used for the payrun, choose the pay frequency then 'Some' and the employee.  
In the SMP column enter the AMOUNT. Quit.  
In the employee Details/M.P.A.S', remove the 'Weeks Not Paid' and increase the 'Weeks Paid' presumably to 39. Mark this as 'Finished'.  
You can do the P45.  
You can now do the RTI/FPS.
