# Employee Details Pay

### This show the pay items, hours, and payment rate for each employee.

**Pay Items**  
This is where you enter the pay information of the employee. This will normally be the wage elements that are subject to
Tax & Nic's  
The grid shows the current payments that the employee gets.

**No**  
This can be manually changed to position the payment up or down in the ordering sequence. The grid requires to be refreshed ( go to another tab and then return) to show its new position ie saved.  
This order will also show on the payslips.

**Description**  
This the definition of what the payment is for.

**Unit**  
This is the unit of payment ie 1 salary or 30 hours, etc thus if you are paying for a 32 hour week enter 32 here.

**Rate**  
The rate you are paying the employee.
This could be 1/12 of their annual salary if paid monthly, or the hourly rate if you are entering the hours worked above.

**Total to Date**  
This is the cumulative amount that has been paid to date. CalcPay will update this automatically after each pay period.
It can be manually altered.

**Add pay item**  
This adds a new payment line to the grid.

**Remove pay item**  
This will remove the line that is highlighted in the grid. ('Total to Date' needs to be 0.00)

**Create New Pay Heading**  
This creates a new pay heading which you can then add via 'Add pay item'.

**Parenting Weekly Pay**  
When an employee is on a statutory parenting payment then the employer's Pension contribution needs to be calculated on the employees normal pay, not the SMP/SPPetc pay. Enter the average normal pay here.

**Holiday Days Outstanding**  
You can enter the number of days of holiday that the employee has yet to receive. This will print on the payslip. If you leave it blank it will not print. The figure can be adjusted each pay run in the Process Payroll form. I dot **NOT** recommend that you use this.

**Normal Hours worked in a week**  
This is their normal hours, if they normally do overtime then include that as well.  
This is reported to HMRC.  
You do not need to calculate this for every pay period.  
For monthly paid calculate their normal yearly hours and divide by 52.  
If they are on holiday enter their normal hours.  
If they are sick or on Statutory leave enter their normal hours.

**52 Week Average**  
This is used to calculate the rate of holiday pay.  
This will show you 'Pay 52 Week History'  
It displays the current years pay items together with the period payments for last year. You can enter your own Start and End dates. The running Totals are displayed in the bottom right grid.

**Share Incentive Payment**  
This is for future development.
