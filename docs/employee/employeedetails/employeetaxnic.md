If you have an employee who is not paid regularly then HMRC will take them off the books if they have not been paid in a 3 month period.  
Tick this to prevent that happening. eg a Director that may only be paid once or twice a year or a woman on unpaid maternity absence.

**One off Payment**  
Use this if the employee is to be paid once only.

Tick if the employee is a director. The Directors NIC's are calculated on a cumulative basis.

Directors have a different NIC calculation, it is calculated on a yearly basis.  
If the director's income is regular you may wish to click 'Even Out NIC Payments' as this then evens out the NIC deductions for each pay period as if they were an employee.  
Unclick this ('Even Out NIC Payments') when:  
prior to last payment when Dir leaves,  
or if income is irregular,  
or Dir's NIC Letter changes during the year,
