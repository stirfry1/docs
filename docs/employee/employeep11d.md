# P11D Entry

This is where the P11D's are entered for employees.\
This is used to record the P11D information for each employee. \This has been prepared for sending the P11D's online.\

All the employees are shown on the left. ( Not just the P11D employees. )

You must 'Create P11D' for each employee you want a P11D for.
You can use 'Delete' to remove the employees P11D, (nb the Car information is not deleted, but can be ignored).

Enter the appropriate information as required. Use the 'Grids' to enter the correct pay types.

The '1A' box  records the Cash Equivalent Figures for  Class 1A contributions for that employee.\
The 'All' box records the sum of all Cash Equivalent Figures for all Class 1A contributions. This requires to be manually refreshed, click on a tab.\
This is the amount prior to calculating the Class 1A NIC at 13.8% (2016/17 rate)

**HMRC P11d Guide**\

There is a problem with the printing of the forms.
The official P11D(2011) prints right to the bottom of page 1. The printer drivers that we have used do not allow this. Thus we have left the 'Cash equivalent of fuel for each car' & 'Total cash equivalent of fuel for all cars' off of the official printout, they will have to be entered manually.
To print on PLAIN paper choose 'Output = D', this will display the report, then just print using the print Icon.
To print to the OFFICIAL form choose 'P' in output choices, this will then only print the boxed entries.

 

**No expenses**\
If HMRC have asked you to submit a P11D(b), you can tell them you donâ€™t owe Class 1A National Insurance by completing a declaration.
No P11D return due
