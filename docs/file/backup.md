# Backup

## This is where you backup your payroll data - normally to a removable Disk.
Remember that the computer you are using WILL breakdown sometime. It also might get stolen or destroyed (fire).

Taking a backup of your data files is VERY important. It should be done every time you add information.
We recommend that you should backup after every wage run.
We also suggest that a backup is kept off site.
You should use separate disks for Odd & Even Week/Months.
You should also RESTORE from a backup on a regular basis. (This ensures that the backup is good)

From  Year 2008_09 the zip files are password protected with a default password.

Current Data Folder

To Drive

You can change the default storage folder  by clicking the '...' button or at 'Utilities/File_Utilities/Change backup drive'.
DO NOT BACKUP TO THE ZIP FOLDER  This is used internally when restoring CalcPay. It will delete everything thats saved there.
