### This fleshes out Getting Started Basic

**Employer Details**  
'Employer/EmployerDetails'.  
A lot of reports take information from this form. Please fill it in as best as possible.

**Add Employees**  
'Employee/EmployeeDetails/NewEmployee', use the 'Entering employees into a payroll you have taken over'.  
This is the most labourious part. Every question is there for a reason, though a lot may not be relevant to some employees.

**Pay**  
Employee/EmployeeDetails/Pay'.  
The Description is a dropdown box to select what you want.
'Add pay item' to enter a new pay Description.
'Create New Pay Heading' allows you to generate a new description.
There are two sections in 'Employer/PayHeadings', 'Pay' & Additions & Deductions', Pay is what is normally used.  
Hopefully most of the entries already there will do what you will require, if not just 'Add' a new heading.


**Pension**  
'Employee/EmployeeDetails/Pension'.  
Pension Scheme' use one of Nest, Peoples Pension, Now, or Other.  
Do not use the old non A.E. Pension schemes.  
You can change 'Other' in 'AEPension/PensionScheme', use the dropdown 'Lookup' and find 'Other', enter the name you want in 'Description'. When saved via 'OK' this will change 'Other' to your requested name.  

**EACH WEEK/MONTH** (Pay Period) 

**PayRun**  
For each pay frequency (weekly 2W, 4W, monthly) run the CalcPay for the correct date.  
Within each pay group you can choose who to run through the system.  
Enter hours in 'Amount'.  
This will then do all the sums required to arrive at the correct pay & deductions.
**SSP** can be entered (you just enter a 's' for the days off), calculated & recorded here.  
If the required information has been entered in the employee records the Pension, Attachments, SMP,SPP,SAP will all be calculated.  
'Holiday Advance' ie paying for this week & next week can also be entered and all the calculations will be updated.

**Print/Email Payslips**  
These can be printed on plain paper or commercial payslips.  
The payslips can also be emailed, ePayslip.

**Print period reports**  
Individual & summary totals for each heading are available both employee & employer.

**Update Records** 
At the push of a button all this information is recorded to the master records for filing & subsequent analysis.

**Full Payment Submission**  
In 'Rti/FPS' the payrun information is sent to HMRC.

**MONTHLY**  
Run P32, 'Reports/P32'. This will provide all the information required to complete the P30 payments.  
If you are reclaiming Parenting payments then send in a 'RTI/EPS'.


**YEAREND**  
Print 60, 'Reports/P60' need to be given to each employee working at the end of the wear. They can be Emailed.
