# Pensions Schemes

## This is the Auto Enrolment pension schemes information.

This is to prepare the Auto Enrolment pension schemes that you can then apply to the employee as required.

This is for Auto Enrolment pensions from NEST, NOW,  Peoples Pension & Others

**Lookup**\
Choose which pension you wish to work on.

**Type**\
This must be AE Auto Enrollment

**Description**\
Change the description to include the pension schemes providers name, This will then update the 'Lookup' when it is saved.

**Payment.**\
There are 3 payments, Employee, Employer, and Employees AVC.\
Each must be PERCENTAGE of their pensionable income. The AVC can be a NET figure.\
Enter the rate to be deducted.\
This figure can be overridden for each employee in 'Employee/EmployeeDetails/Pension'

Full Tax Relief ie **'Net Pay Arrangement'** 
'Now', 'Creative Pension', 'SmartPension' use this method.\
'Peoples Pension' can be setup to use this.\
The pension contribution reduces the taxable pay. This allows automatic tax relief for basic and higher tax payers. Non tax payers do not get any tax relief, they would be better off with the 'Relief at Source' type scheme. HMRC Manuals

Basic Rate Tax Relief ie **'Relief at source'**\
The majority of pension providers use this method, ie 'Nest', 'Peoples Pension'.\
The basic tax rate is taken off after tax, but the pension deduction is reduced by the basic tax rate.\
The Effective Rate reflects this.\
Assuming there is a National Insurance number then the Pension Provider reclaims the basic tax relief (20%) from HMRC. This means everybody gets at least basic tax relief, including NON tax payers. Higher paid employees will need to send in a Tax Assessment form to reclaim their higher rate tax relief.
HMRC Manuals
