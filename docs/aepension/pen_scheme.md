# Pensions Schemes

### This is the Auto Enrolment pension schemes information.

This is to prepare the Auto Enrolment pension schemes that you can then apply to the employee as required.

This is for Auto Enrolment pensions from NEST, NOW,  Peoples Pension & Others

**Lookup**  
Choose which pension you wish to work on.

**Type**  
This must be AE Auto Enrollment

**Description**  
Change the description to include the pension schemes providers name, This will then update the 'Lookup' when it is saved. This is best used in 'Other', so you can change the name to the P.P. you require.

**Payment.**  
There are 3 payments, Employee, Employer, and Employees AVC.  
Each must be PERCENTAGE of their pensionable income. The AVC can be a NET figure.  
Enter the rate to be deducted, the default figures ar 5 & 3.  
This figure can be overridden for each employee in 'Employee/EmployeeDetails/Pension'.

Full Tax Relief ie **'Net Pay Arrangement'** 
  'Now', 'Creative Pension', 'SmartPension' use this method.  
  'Peoples Pension' can be setup to use this after you have obtained permission from them.  
  The pension contribution reduces the taxable pay. This allows automatic tax relief for basic and higher tax payers. Non tax payers do not get any tax relief, they would be better off with the 'Relief at Source' type scheme.

Basic Rate Tax Relief ie **'Relief At Source'**\
  Nest', 'Peoples Pension' use this method.  
  The basic tax rate is taken off after tax, but the pension deduction is reduced by the basic tax rate.  
  The Effective Rate reflects this.
  Assuming there is a National Insurance number then the Pension Provider reclaims the basic tax relief (20%) from HMRC. This means everybody gets at least basic tax relief, including NON tax payers. Higher paid employees will need to send in a Tax Assessment form to reclaim their higher rate tax relief.

**Calculate from Pensionable Income or Gross:**  
  **Pensionable Income** If the pension is to be calculated from the elements of income that have been described as Pensionable in 'Employer/Pay Headings'.  
  **Gross Pay** If the pension is to be calculated from ALL of the GROSS income.  
  Gross income is defined as **all** the entries you put in the PAY section of the 'Employee\EmployeeDetails\Pay'.

**Restrict Pensionable Income to All or pension earnings Bands:**  
**All Pensionable Income** for All income ie **Gross Pay**  or **Pensionable Income**, as above.  
**Qualifying Earnings Band** from **Gross Pay**  or **Pensionable Income** but restricted to use the current 'Lower level of qualifying earnings' and 'Upper level of qualifying earning' this is currently the Qualifying Earnings Band.

**Administrator**  
Enter the name of pension company who the scheme is with. Not required.

**Employer Pension Scheme Ref.**  
Enter the Administrators reference. This is used when sending monies to the P.P.

**re Nest.**  
**Nest Payment Source:** What you have entered in Nest to call your payment, Nest defaults to 'My source'.  
EPSR is 'EMPnnnnnnnnn' where n is numeric numbers.

**re Smart Pension.**  
Use Full Tax Relief.  
Administrator: enter smartpension, notice no capitals or spaces.  
EPSR is only the ref no, it does not include the name.  
In 'EmployeeDetails/Pension/Group' the normal entry is 'default',  note all lower case.
