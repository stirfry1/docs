# Pension Contributions

## This is where you send what you have deducted from the employees to the Pension Provider.

You **Choose** what payrun you are sending.

You click on the **Pension Scheme** and hit **Proceed**

 

This will present you with a grid where you can **Choose** which employees to send.

Some of them will have a 'Start' and 'End' dates. This needs to be in accordance with how you set up the Pension Provider.\
To save having to change these dates each time, you can alter the default Start and End dates, by changing the **Master Change** figure.


You will have an option to **Generate File** which will produce a CSV file that you can upload to the Pension Provider.
**Nest** allows you to use their **Web Service** which directly sends the data to Nest's servers.

When you **Quit** you will have an option of confirming that you have sent the Data.
