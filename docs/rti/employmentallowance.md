# Claim Employment Allowance



## HMRC allows you to recover the first Â£5000.00 of Employers NIC payments



To check for eligibility please read this info.


To claim you need to:\
Tick  'Tick if eligible for the allowance'.\
'Prepare XML'.\
'SendToHMRC'.\
This will then show the amounts of NIC that can be recovered in the 'Reports/P32' forms.

You need to claim this every year.



To UNCLAIM
UNTICK 'Tick if eligible for the allowance'.\
'Prepare XML'/\
'SendToHMRC'.\
The 'Reports/P32' will no longer show the E.A. amounts.



The 'Employer/EmployerDetails/Employment Allowance' will reflect the current position.
If you have taken over an employer which has previously sent in a E.A. claim you can manually adjust this here.
