# Full Payment Submission

## This is used to send details of every payrun to HMRC via the Government Gateway.

**Grid**\
Choose the Pay Date, (week/month) that you want to send. It will normally be the last one.\
Do this by clicking the **choose** checkbox.\
You are unable to send a return in for a date that has already been sent.
This will enable the 'Send to HMRC', the 'Send Test to HMRC' and 'Show XML' will also be enabled.\
WARNING: Because this is date driven please ensure you have done the payruns for ALL the employees that are going to be paid for that date BEFORE you send in the FPS.\
If you have restored from a backup then it is likely that the 'Date Sent' will be blank even though you have previously sent it in. You can check what you have previously sent in to HMRC in Gateway/History, as this is not affected by a restore.\

**Final FPS for the year**\
(Click on this AFTER you have clicked on 'Choose')\
At the end of the year you need to tell HMRC that this is the last FPS that will be sent in for the year.
You will be taken to the declaration page where you will want to click on 'Yes' then 'OK'.\
If the PAYE Scheme is stopping then you can also enter the 'Date of CESSATION', you should have previously marked everyone as left.\
If you have already sent in the last payrun then you can also send in the declaration via 'RTI/EPS'.

**Send to HMRC**\
This will send the submission to HMRC via the Government Gateway.
Upon a successful submission the 'Date Sent' field will be updated and you will be returned to a blank screen.

**Show XML**\
This will let you view the XML file that you are sending, probably in Internet Explorer.

**Send Test to HMRC**\
This will send a test submission to HMRC via the Government Gateway.
You do not need to send this, if you do, then you will be returned to this form after the test submission.
