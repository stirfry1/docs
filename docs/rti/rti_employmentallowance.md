# Claim Employment Allowance.

### This allows you to recover the first Â£10,500.00 of Employers NIC payments.

To check for eligibility please read this info.  
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/employment-allowance-more-detailed-guidance


To claim you need to:  
Tick  'Tick if eligible for the allowance'.  
do the **State Aid Declaration**  
'Prepare XML'.  
'SendToHMRC'.  
This will then show the amounts of NIC that can be recovered in the 'Reports/P32' forms.

You need to claim this **EVERY** year.



To UNCLAIM
UNTICK 'Tick if eligible for the allowance'.  
'Prepare XML'  
'SendToHMRC'.  
The 'Reports/P32' will no longer show the E.A. amounts.



The 'Employer/EmployerDetails/ApprenticeLevy', 'Employment Allowance' will reflect the current position.
If you have taken over an employer which has previously sent in a E.A. claim you can manually adjust this here.
