# Reports Modify the report layout.

### The report layout can be modified.

**Select report file**  
Select the report file you wish to change.  
The reports are in the 'reports' folder.  

You will now be in the 'Report Designer'.
This is made up of:
Page Header  
Group Header  
Detail  
Group Footer  
Page Footer  

The 'Boxes' are field names, ie surname, add1 etc. They should not be changed. Double click on the box for more info.  
The black type is Text, you can change this. Double click on the text for more info.  

I suggest you save the two files first with another name and work on this revised file.  
ie myfile.frt & myfile.frx to myfileextra.frt & myfileextra.frx.
