**E.P.S.D. Adjust Days +-**  
Nest, Peoples Pension, & Papdis requires a Earnings Period Start Date to be entered for each of its contribution files.  
If it is 0 then the EPSD and EPED in the contribution files will be the Tax Period dates.  
For Weekly files this will be taken as a Wednesday (because 6th April 2016 is a Wednesday). If you wish to have the EPSD start say on  Monday then enter -2. (6/4/17 is a Thursday so you will need to change this to -3 to get it back to Monday)  
For Nest if it is 0 the Weekly pay frequency will display as 'Tax Weekly', Monthly pay frequency will display as 'Tax Monthly'.  
For Monthly it will default to EPSD of the 6th to the EPED of the following 5th. If you wish it to start on the first day of the month enter -5, being 6th less 5 days giving 1st.  
month1 would be 1st April to 30th April  
month2 would be 1st May to 31stMay, etc

If you have both Weekly and Monthly employees I recommend you set up the above for the more common weekly settings, and manually adjust dates in the 'AEPension/All Contribution Reports' for monthly returns.

see also Pension Nest CS  for details regarding above.
