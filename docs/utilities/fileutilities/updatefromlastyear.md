# Update from last year

## This brings forward all the employees & info from last year.

You must NOT be in LAST years company. Either come out of  CalcPay or go to another company.

You must be in a BLANK company before you can bring the data across.\ Run 'Utilities/File utilities/Clear All Data' if need be.

If you have 5 employers in last year then create 5 in this year. ( just call the comp1, comp2 etc)

Go to 'Utilities/YearStart/GetLast years employees'

**This year folder.**\
This will display which company folder you are in. ie C:\CALCPAY\PAY24_25\COMP8\PAY\   

**Last years folder.**\
This should make an intelligent guess as to where last years data is.\ ie C:\CALCPAY\PAY18_19\COMP8\PAY\ \
If it displays the correct information all you have to do is press OK

 (...)
If the default entry for last year is not correct then you will have to find Last Years folder using the Browse button, (...)
You must go down the folder list until you come to the 'Pay' folder


OK
This brings across all the employee files.

It will then pull all the information across.
It will display any irregularities that it finds, you should note these & check them.\
It will then popup a window reminding you to go to 'Employer details & save'. This ensures that the company name is registered on the MultiCompany table.\s
It will then display the 'Clears Cumulative totals' with a default of 'Y'. This zeroes the running totals for each of the payment types. You might wish to change any loans etc to 'N' to enable this running total to continue.

Thats it.

You should review the employee details file to ensure all is well.

Running totals of the following are brought over
SSP
SMP
