# Execute

### This allows you to compile & run a program.

This is normally used to run a specialist program, such as a procedure to convert the entries in a time sheet to a layout that CalcPay can use to Amend the Hours.

Do not use it unless you have been instructed to do so.  

**Get .prg**  
This locates the program file '*.prg'  

**Execute**  
This compiles & runs the file.
