# Mid Year Start

## This is instructions on how to start CalcPay mid way through the year from a manual system.

Seriously consider if you can run CalcPay from the beginning of the year. Most of the effort is in putting in the employees details.

The object is to put the TOTALS from the Manual System into CalcPay.

Please do these totals at a monthend on the P11 to enable CalcPay to calculate the correct future SSP & SMP.

You should have already entered the employee details.

Ensure that you have entered the P45 details for any employee who has started in the year. You do this via 'Employee/EmployeeDetails/Tax_Nic' 'P6/LateP45 Pay&Tax'.

You will need to add up the manual P11 Cards. These figures for the basis of what you need to enter in the P11.

Enter the Date of the previous payrun that you have the totals for. You need to do the different pay periods separately.\
Click the appropriate Pay period.

The columns that you need to populate are per P11 Entry.

An employee who has left will not show up in the P11. You need to 'Unleave' him. 'Employee/EmployeeDetails' 'P45Leaver'. Make a note of the leaving date, go into the P45 and delete the leaving date. After you have dealt with the P11 entries put the leaving date back in.

Ensure that any new starts for the current year have had their P45 entered.

You are now ready to start entering the P11 information.

For NIC change employees enter Wk/Mt no & Nic totals only.
