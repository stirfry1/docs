# Tronc

### This is where a separate PAYE system is used to pay tips, gratuities and service charges.

You set up the employees with a NIC Letter of 'X'. This means neither the employee or employer will pay NICs on the tips.  
A **troncmaster** is used to run the scheme. They cannot be a Officeholder.  
You need to consider the time costs of running the scheme are less than the NIC savings.
