# RTI Errors

### Here are some of the common RTI errors.
7806
"This submission cannot be accepted as it does not fall within the
eligible filing period."
This actually has two meanings.
1) What it actually says when you are sending in an 'No Employees Paid' report. ie you have gone for a bad choice of dates.
2) HMRC has actually removed the PAYE Scheme. You will need to contact HMRC via the Helpline 03002003200 or Online Services 03002003600

1046
"The supplied user credentials failed validation for the requested service."
In 'Employer/EmployerDetails/TaxOffice'
1) All the items marked with a 'R' have been entered.  
2) I take it you are sending in the return as an Employer, ie NOT as an AGENT. Ensure 'Send as Agent' is unticked, ditto 'Send as Bureau'.  
3) Press 'Alt+F9', a 'ShowPasswords' pops up, click on it, your password will be revealed. Check if this is OK  
4) Leaving this form open , 'Gateway/Login to HMRC', this will open a web browser on the 'Gov.uk' site. Enter the 'User Id' & 'Password' that are displayed in CalcPay into the web browser [use 'Ctrl+A', 'Ctrl+C' to copy & 'Ctrl+V' to paste] & 'Sign in'. This will confirm two of your credentials. Go into the PAYE section and you should see the Tax Office information, check they are the same as what CalcPay has.  
5) You also need to check the 'Accounts Office Ref.', I do not think this is displayed on the HMRC site so check it against your payment book.  
6) If this has not solved your problem then it can be that HMRC has refused your credentials so you will need to check with them. Try the Online Services 03002003600 or Helpline 03002003200
