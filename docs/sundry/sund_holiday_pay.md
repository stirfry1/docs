# Holiday Pay

### This shows you how to calculate holiday pay.

There is an article by ACAS <a href="https://www.acas.org.uk/checking-holiday-entitlement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> here. </a>  

Employees still accrue holiday entitlement while on statutory leave, SMP, SAP, SPP, ShPP,SBP, SNcP, SSP  

In some circumstances Voluntary overtime should be included in holiday pay calculation.
July 2017:The EAT found that if voluntary shifts and other additional duties performed on a voluntary basis formed part of normal pay, then this should be included in holiday pay calculations to avoid any financial disadvantages that could occur from an employee opting to take leave rather than working.
So you need to consider what 'NORMAL' pay is.



The Court of Justice of the European Union has ruled that a retired worker can claim holiday pay for both unpaid or untaken annual leave accrued during his 13-year tenure.

**Calculation of Holiday Pay**  
There are two methods:
    Regular hour employees. This is paid at their normal rate, but if they have other payments, ie Overtime, this must be included in the pay rate. A '52 week average' is available for perusal.

    Rolled-up Holiday Pay. from 01/04/24 employers can use rolled-up holiday pay, but only for irregular hour and part-time workers.  
    This is calculated at 12.07% of the total pay. It must be entered as a separate line on the payslip.
